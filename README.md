# Portfolio Task

During my internship at Codesoft, I successfully completed a portfolio task where I designed a comprehensive website showcasing my projects, skills, and accomplishments. The portfolio includes a diverse range of projects and highlights my proficiency in various areas. I am deeply grateful to Codesoft for this invaluable opportunity to learn and grow. Their support and guidance have been instrumental in enhancing my skills in web development and design.
